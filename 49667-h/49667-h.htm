<h2 id="BEST_MET">Best Methods of Placing Machine.</h2>


<p>The machine complete and ready for operation
weighs 1,925 pounds. In operation there is no
vibration, and the machine may be safely placed in
any building of ordinary strength.</p>

</div>

<p>Each machine requires somewhat less than one-quarter
of a horsepower to drive it, but the allowance
of one-half horsepower is recommended to
insure steadiness of motion.</p>

<p>Each machine, including overhanging projections,
is a little less than five feet square.</p>

<p>In placing machines allowance must be made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
space sufficient to pass around and between them,
and for seat of operator in front. A liberal allowance
is 7x10 feet.</p>

<p>The driving pulley of the machine is 14½ inches
in diameter and should be driven at about 62 revolutions
per minute. <i>Never to exceed 66.</i> Any
arrangement of shafting and pulleys which will
secure this speed will answer.</p>

<h2 id="LIN_MOTOR">Linotype Motor.</h2>


<p>The Linotype Company has recently had a specially
designed electric motor built which is adapted
for speedy application to Linotype machines.
These motors are cheap, compact, reliable and
pleasing in appearance. Their application demands
no change in the machine except to remove the
driving pulley and substitute a gear wheel furnished
with the motor.</p>

<p>The only connection required is the extension of
a wire to an ordinary incandescent lamp socket or
other suitable source of electric power. The use
of these motors avoid the necessity for countershafts,
pulleys and belts, and greatly improve the
appearance of the office.</p>

<p>Motors wound for 115, 230 and 500 volts are carried
in stock. The price, with all attachments,
applicable to any machine, is $65.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="MACH_FACT">The Machine as It Comes from the Factory and
How to Erect It.</h2>


<p>In shipping the machine the base and heavy
parts, such as column, metal pot, cams, vise, etc.,
are assembled. The base being bolted with lag
screws to three skids and boxed up, with the distributer
bracket and step cleated in the top.</p>

<p>A second box, 20x24x18 inches, contains the
key-board and reeds, intermediate bracket, channel-plate
support, and all the small parts, such as
vise-locking screws, flexible front, pi box and tube,
second elevator, distributer box, keyboard rod
guide assembled, all carriages, etc.</p>

<p>A third box, 44x26x16 inches, contains face plate
assembled, magazine, set of matrices, two small
boxes, one containing large and small assembler
glasses, the other the magazine entrance.</p>

<p>A fourth box, 46x9x12 inches, contains distributer
assembled and first elevator.</p>

<p>Take boards from base and roll it to its permanent
position and remove skids, then cut the wires
that bind levers C and J (Fig. 4). Then turn
clutch A to the right until second elevator lever J
(Fig. 4) is in the position shown in Fig. 5 and put
on the distributer bracket A (Fig. 5). Then, in
the order given, put on intermediate bracket D,
upper rod guide F, channel plate support E, second
elevator C (Fig. 5), and vise-locking screws 2 and
3 (Fig. 4).</p>

<p>Then put on keyboard C (Fig. 6) and put in rods
B (Fig. 6), which are numbered consecutively, beginning
with No. 1 at the left. Then put on first
elevator A (Fig. 6), distributer N (Fig. 5), and
belt P (Fig. 5), which should always be crossed so
as to run away from the gears.</p>

<p>Now, with machine in position (Fig. 6), put on
face plate N (Fig. 7), which is held by the three
cap screws 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 6), and magazine A
and flexible front and glass C (Fig. 7) and connect
spaceband lever, spaceband transfer carriage, distributer
shifter carriages, line delivery carriage,
assembling elevator, etc. Reversing these directions
will, of course, show how to take the machine
apart.</p>

<p>Before putting on driving belt it is advisable to
turn machine over by hand, to be sure everything
is all right. If all parts are connected properly
there should be no binding and machine should
turn easily.</p>

<h2 id="TEMP_MET">Temperature of the Metal.</h2>


<p>It is essential that the temperature of the metal
should be kept uniform. If the temperature is too
high, porous or spongy slugs will result, also defective
faces and a weak surface, which allows the
letters to sink in printing.</p>

<p>A temperature that is too low causes the metal
to adhere to the mouthpiece and prevents the free
flow of the metal to the mold.</p>

<p>We recommend that the metal in front of the
well be kept at a temperature anywhere between
536 and 563 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature
can be kept uniform by means of the gas
governor attached to each machine, and can be
supplemented by a gas pressure governor attached
to supply pipe. (See Fig. 10.)</p>

<p>The temperature can be ascertained by plunging
a thermometer reading up to 600 degrees Fahrenheit
into the molten metal in front of the well and
readings taken when the mercury remains constant.
Heat the thermometer before plunging it
into the metal. The bulb should be wholly covered
by the molten metal.</p>

<p>When no thermometer is at hand the temperature
may be obtained approximately by plunging a
piece of paper into the molten metal. If it turns
brown the metal is in a proper condition to cast.
The temperature is too low if only a slight color is
imparted to the paper; too high if a deep brown or
black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>No other metal, such as brass, zinc, or stereotype
metal should be mixed with linotype metal.
It has been found that better results are obtained if
the slugs are melted in a proper furnace and cast
into ingots or blocks.</p>

<p>The pot will be kept more free from dross by this
method than by melting the slugs in the metal pot
of the machine.</p>


<h2 id="GAS_CON">The Gas Connections and Governor.</h2>


<p>For one machine use a ½-inch supply pipe, and
increase about ¼-inch for each additional machine,
a 2-inch pipe being sufficient for a plant of twelve
machines. A ½-inch feed pipe should be run to
each machine.</p>

<p>A gas governor is furnished by the Linotype
Company, as shown in Fig. 10, which should be
attached to the main pipe near the machines. This
governor, together with the one on the machine,
will keep the gas at a uniform pressure. The governor
(Fig. 10) works as follows:</p>

<p>When the gas pressure becomes too heavy it
raises the float B, which sets in mercury at point
J and A, and closes the valve C, points 1 and 2.</p>

<p>A small bottle of mercury is sent with each governor;
also two small lead weights, which go on
top of float B. The arrows show how the gas
enters and leaves the governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="PUR_MET">Purifying the Metal.</h2>


<p>The metal may be purified if, when in a molten
state, a piece of green wood about 4 inches in
diameter and 7 or 8 inches long, attached to an
iron rod, is plunged into the molten metal and
allowed to remain about 20 minutes, or until the
boiling ceases.</p>

<p>The green wood causes the metal to boil violently,
and the oxides contained in the interior of
the molten metal are affectually reduced.</p>

<p>The metal should then be thoroughly stirred and
the scum removed by an iron ladle.</p>

<p>The dross on the surface may be reduced by
adding a few ounces of rosin to the molten mass.</p>

<h2 id="FORMATION">Formation of Dross Upon the Surface of Linotype
Metal.</h2>


<p>Dross is a compound formed by the action of air
upon molten metal. The oxygen contained in the
atmosphere attacks most metals with which we are
acquainted. The formation of this oxide takes
place more rapidly and in larger quantities the
higher the temperature of the metal.</p>

<p>This oxidation only occurs upon the surface of
molten metal where the air has access and not in
the center of the molten mass. It is easy to skim
this dross from the metal by means of an iron
ladle. It can then be reduced to metal during the
operation of melting the slugs into blocks already
described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>If this is done little loss will result. The principle
of its reduction to the metallic state is this:</p>

<p>If such dross is heated in contact with carbonaceous
material, such as rosin, the carbon and
resulting gases formed in the process take away
the oxygen contained in the dross, liberating the
metal.</p>

<h2 id="CARE_FRIC">Care of Friction Clutch.</h2>


<p>Care should be taken to keep the inside rim of
pulley and clutch leather shoes free from oil; if
not, the clutch will slip and fail to turn machine
over. The clutch and pulleys should be taken off
every two weeks and cleaned and oiled; if not,
they will become dry on the shaft and cause the
mold disk to carry over when the machine stops.</p>

<p>To take off the clutch and pulleys unscrew the
nut E (Fig. 13) and loosen screw which holds
clutch on the shaft; then clean shaft N (Fig. 11);
then put it back and adjust as described in Adjustment
of Automatic Stop.</p>

<p>The friction clutch spring S (Fig. 11) is sometimes
too weak, and should be strengthened or
renewed. To take out this spring, unscrew the
cap or end of shaft as shown in Fig. 11.</p>

<h2 id="ADJ_NEW">To Adjust New Style Automatic Stop.</h2>


<p>First—Adjust the automatic stopping pawl A
(Fig. 14) to 15-16 inch from side of cam to back of
pawl and adjust automatic safety pawl the same.</p>

<p>Second—Set the automatic stopping lever C
(Fig. 14) so as to engage 3-16 inch with automatic
stopping pawl A. Then clamp the vertical starting
lever shaft K with set screw D (Fig. 12).</p>

<p>Third—By the adjusting nut E (Fig. 13) adjust
the driving shaft clutch flange F (Fig. 12) to 29-64
inch from end of driving shaft bearing G (Fig.
12); then tighten check nut.</p>

<p>Fourth—By means of adjusting screw H (Fig.
12) take up the lost motion between the contact
points I and J (Fig. 12), leaving 1-32 inch play;
then tighten check nut.</p>

<p>To set friction clutch on machines with old-style
automatic stop, simply tighten the nut E (Fig. 13)
until there is 1-16 inch between flange F and driving
shaft bearing G (Fig. 12), with starting lever
open; then set vise automatic.</p>

<h2 id="SET_VISE">To Set Vise Automatic.</h2>


<p>First set eccentric screw 6 (Fig. 15) on inner
end of stopping and starting lever connection rod
8 (Fig. 15) so as to take up all lost motion between
it and the vertical starting lever. Then set the
eccentric screw 7 (Fig. 15) on outer end of the
connecting rod 8 so as to take up all lost motion
between it and vise automatic stop lever 4 (Fig.
15). To do this, pull out the vise automatic stop
lever 4 with your finger until the inside end bears
firmly against the vise automatic stop rod 1, which,
in turn, comes in contact with the vise automatic
stop mold disk dog 3 (Fig. 15); then pull out the
starting and stopping hand lever 2 (Fig. 15) until
machine starts. At the time when the machine
starts the eccentric screw 7 should touch the outer
end of the vise automatic stop lever 4, then there
would be no lost motion and the vise automatic
would act as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In case of a tight line (which would not allow
the first elevator to drop into the vise far enough
to force the vise automatic stop rod 1 down to
allow the mold disk dog 3 to pass over the pawl
5 in the stop rod 1) the disk coming forward would
force the mold disk dog 3 against the pawl 5 in stop
rod 1 which, coming in contact with inner end of
vise automatic stop lever 4, would force the outer
end of stop lever against eccentric screw 7, which
would cause the machine to be shut off the same
as if it were done by pushing the hand lever in by
hand.</p>

<p>If the vise automatic is set this way it will stop
mold disk nearly 1-16 inch away from matrices,
leaving the first elevator free to lift up and a matrix
to be taken out. This not only prevents a
squirt, but saves the ears of the matrices in many
cases.</p>

<h2 id="PREV_TRAN">To Prevent Transposition of Matrices.</h2>


<p>In order to prevent transposition of matrices and
spacebands the parts should be adjusted as illustrated
in Fig. 31.</p>

<p>The assembler chute spring A, which lays between
spaceband chute B and assembler rail C,
should be set as low as its banking piece “a” will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
permit. Its lower end should be about midway
between the lower end of the spaceband chute B
and matrix catch spring E, and in line with them.</p>

<p>The space between the spring A and rail C at
point 2 should be equal to the thickness of the capital
W matrix.</p>

<p>The spaceband buffer F should be adjusted so
that each band as it falls into the line will be supported
by the buffer, with its ear about 1-32 inch
above the top of the assembler rail.</p>

<p>The buffer wire should have a slight inclination
downward toward the left, so that the ears of the
bands will settle down as the line is assembled.</p>

<p>The matrix catch spring E should project
through the assembler plate a sufficient distance to
catch each matrix as it passes, and prevent it from
falling back to the right.</p>

<p>The assembler slide brake H and spring L should
be adjusted to prevent the assembler slide from
jumping ahead to the left or continually vibrating
as the matrices enter. If the assembler vibrates it
makes it impossible for the operator to read the
line, and the last letter will sometimes fall out when
the assembling elevator is raised. This is caused
by the brake H wearing at points 3 and 4, which
lessens the tension of the spring L and takes up the
space between bottom screw J and brake lever K at
point 6, which should be about 1-32 inch. If brake
H is not too badly worn at points 3 and 4 this
trouble can be obviated by strengthening spring L<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and turning up screw J until you have about 1-32
inch space at point 6. Be careful not to get too
much space at point 6, or the assembler slide would
not return when the line has been released from
the assembling elevator.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="ASSE_STAR">The Assembler Star and Friction Spring.</h2>


<p>The assembler star should be renewed as soon
as it is worn sufficient to prevent it from pushing
the matrices inside the assembling elevator pawls,
and it is advisable to renew the assembler chute
rails at the same time.</p>

<p>The assembler star friction spring sometimes
gets too weak to hold the star and it will slip. The
assembler star friction disk will also wear out.</p>

<p>To renew these, take off the assembler Fig. 17
(this shows back view) and unscrew the nut C.</p>

<p>This cut also shows the intermediate gear B and
assembler belt driving pulley A.</p>

<h2 id="SET_DIST">To Set Distributer Bar.</h2>


<p>The distributer bar has a strip of brass about
1-16 inch wide set into it just above the combinations.</p>

<p>In setting it for height be careful not to set it too
low. If set too low the matrix, in leaving the distributer
box, will bind between the distributer box
upper rails N (Fig. 27), M (Fig. 26) and the brass
strip. If the matrices bind it will not only bend
the ears, but also wear brass strip.</p>

<p>The bar should be set so that when matrix is
about to leave the rails, and has entered onto the
first combination of the bar, it will rest on the top
of the rails and be perfectly free on the bar.</p>

<p>To make this adjustment, loosen the screws E
and F (Fig. 19) and set the bar with the two set
screws in top of distributer beam.</p>

<p>To set the bar endwise, the distance from the
first combination (e) (Fig. 18) to the outside of
the distributer front screw bracket A (Fig. 18)
should be 2⅞ inches.</p>

<p>In the latest machines built this bar is adjusted
in the factory and a pin driven into it just below
screw F (Fig. 19). If bar is taken out it will
always go back in its proper place, and the end
adjustment will not be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="fs1 smcap">Fig. 18.</span></p></div>
</div>


<h2 id="SET_MAG">To Set the Magazine.</h2>


<p>In setting the magazine first see that the distributer-bar
is set right, as shown in Fig. 18; then
run two pi matrices onto the bar, one at each end,
as 1 and 2 (Fig. 20); then raise or lower the magazine
with screws E and F until there is about
1-16 inch space between the bottom of matrix and
the channel-plate entrance partition at points 1 and
2 (Fig. 20); then tighten check nuts on screws E
and F to prevent them from changing.</p>

<p>Next run a lower case “e” onto the bar by turning
the distributer slowly by hand, and set the magazine
sidewise until the lower case “e” drops as
soon as it passes the second entrance partition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
which would be the right hand partition for the “e”
channel. When the machine is running the momentum
will be sufficient to carry it to the center
of the “e” channel. Then turn out the screws N
and M (Fig. 20) until they touch the sides of the
distributer bracket, and tighten the check nuts on
the screws M and N so they will not change.</p>

<p>The next thing is to set the lower end of the
magazine in relation to the rods J, Fig. 21.</p>

<p>First throw the rods into the verges; then touch
the first and last keyboard buttons, which are lower
case “e” and “—”; then turn rubber roller until
the “e” and “—” rods are at their highest point;
then raise or lower the magazine by screws in
channel-plate support A (Fig. 20) and on column
R (Fig. 5) until there is about 1-32 inch between
the key rod and verge at point 8 (Fig. 32); then
tighten the check nuts B on screws A (Fig. 21).</p>


<h2 id="SET_DISTRI">To Set Distributer Box Lift.</h2>


<p>Turn out screw A (Fig. 20) until the lift C
(Fig. 20) will not come down low enough to pick
up the matrices; then turn the screw A (Fig. 20)
until the lift C will just pick up all the matrices and
tighten check nut on the screw. This will allow
all extra motion to be on the upward motion which
carries the matrix that much higher up into the
distributer screws, so there would be little danger
of bending the ear of the matrix.</p>

<h2 id="REMOVE_SIDE">To Remove Side of Keyboard to Clean Cams.</h2>


<p>The keyboard cams should be taken out and
thoroughly cleaned every six or eight months and
oiled with a drop of clock oil on the journal pin.
This will prevent them from sticking and causing
transposition of the matrices.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p>The easiest way to take out the cams is to take
off the back and front of the keyboard (Fig. 23).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
This is done by taking off the keyboard tray N
(Fig. 23); then taking out screws I and A (Fig.
22) with the keyboard unlocked. The back, of
course, comes off the same way. As these are
dowelled, you would have no trouble in replacing
them.</p>

<p>It will be found easier in putting them back if
a small wire is run through the cam yoke triggers
C (Fig. 31), locking them so they would enter the
keyboard keybars B (Fig. 31) at point 3 (Fig. 31).</p>

<p>Figure 24 shows the keyboard with the front
taken off, showing the keyboard keybars N in
place and lower keyboard rod guide M.</p>


<h2 id="DIST_BOX_RAILS">The Distributer Box and Rails.</h2>


<p>Figure No. 25 shows the distributer-box complete.
The best way to take it apart to renew the
rails B and C (Fig. 28) is to take out screws 1, 2
and 3 (Fig. 25) and take off side (Fig. 26).</p>

<p>The rails M and K (Fig. 26) and N and O
(Fig. 27) have to be renewed when they have worn
(as shown by dotted lines 1 and 2, Fig. 28) enough
to allow two thin matrices to pass between points
1 and 2, rails C and B, and distributer-box bar
pawl 3 (Fig. 28).</p>

<p>If the rails M (Fig. 26) and N (Fig. 27) are
badly worn on the top 2 (Fig. 26) and 4 (Fig. 27)
a matrix is liable to leave the box and enter on the
distributer-bar diagonally, and if the distributer-box
is not set properly the same thing will occur.</p>

<h2 id="SPACEBAND_BOX">The Spaceband Box and Pawls.</h2>


<p>To insure good work the spaceband box should
be kept thoroughly clean.</p>

<p>To clean box, it will be necessary to take it off
the machine and take it apart. To do this take
out screw K (Fig. 29) and screws L, which hold
the spaceband chute; drive out pin J and take off
the pawl lever I (Fig. 29); then take out screws
A and C and take off side.</p>

<p>Figure 30 shows inside of box. The screw 1 in
pawl lever should be adjusted so that when pawl
lever is down the pawls N and O will be low
enough to clear the top rails C and J (Fig. 30)
about 1-32 inch, with the screw resting on spaceband
lever. If too low it will give a double motion
to the pawl lever I (Fig. 29) and sometimes
throw out two spacebands at once and clog the
spaceband chute.</p>

<p>The spaceband center guide A (Fig. 30) will allow
two bands to pass if it is not adjusted properly.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the guide is a half pin or
ear on each side, which is to catch the second
spaceband if pawl lever lifts two. This guide is
adjustable and should be set so as to allow only
one band to pass freely.</p>

<p>The pawls N and O (Fig. 30) have to be renewed
when badly worn. Before putting in new
pawls rub them down on an oil stone, so that when
in place in the box, and moved up and down slowly
by hand, they will stand inside the hooks of the
rails C and J about the width of a spaceband ear,
and both be the same height so as to lift the band
evenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The pawls N and O should work in their slots
perfectly loose. As the pawl levers and pawls drop
by their own weight entirely, it is necessary their
movement should be perfectly free.</p>

<p>When putting spacebands into the box always be
sure the bottom of the first is back of the stop for
spaceband end L (Fig. 30).</p>

<h2 id="KEYBOARD_MAG">Keyboard, Magazine and Connections.</h2>


<p>Figure 31 shows all parts at rest and Fig. 32 the
parts in motion after key lever A has been touched
and the cam D has made one-half revolution. In
Fig. 31 the cam and yoke D is supported about 1-16
inch above the rubber roller E by the trigger C,
which intersects the keyboard keybar B at point 3.</p>

<p>The key rod G, which is suspended from the
verge I at point 8, comes down to about 1-16 inch
from cam yoke at point 6. Note that point 4 on
cam D is only about one-half as far from the journal
pin or cam bearing as point 7. Now, suppose
the rubber roll to be revolving and key lever A
pressed down, this will in turn raise the keybar
B and throw out the trigger C from the cam at
point 5 and allow the cam to strike the revolving
rubber roll E at point 4, which would cause the
cam to turn.</p>

<p>Now suppose we stop the rubber roll when the
cam D has reached point 7 and we get the result
as shown in Fig. 32, <i>i. e.</i>, the cam yoke at point 6
where the rod G rests will be raised high enough
to raise the upper end of rod G at point 8 enough
to allow verge pawl L to release the matrix M,
which in Fig. 31 was held in its place in the magazine
by the verge pawl, then in Fig. 32 the upper
verge pawl K will hold the second matrix N and
prevent it from following the first matrix M out
of the magazine. When the cam D has completed
its revolution or again come round to point 4 all
the parts will have come back to the position shown
in Fig. 31, except that the matrix M will have gone
to the assembler and matrix N have taken its place.
When the rod G is raised (as explained) to its
position in Fig. 32, the verge I is raised by spring
J and brought back again by the rod G, which is
returned by the coiled spring H and the keyboard
keybar B is returned partly by its own weight,
which, if everything is clean, would be sufficient.</p>

<p>But to guard against sticking from dirt or other
causes: The keyboard keybar spring F (sometimes
called the comb spring) is attached and intersects
the keybar B at point 2. R shows a sectional top
view of keyboard rod lower guide T as the slot
10 should be when new, and S shows same when
it is badly worn by the motion of the keyrod G.</p>

<p>When guide slot is worn as shown at 11 (Fig.
32) the keyboard rod is apt to bind and the spring
H would not be strong enough to bring the rod
back to its position. The guide T should then be
renewed and the old one repaired at leisure, by
soldering a piece on the bottom and cutting new
slots.</p>

<p>These parts will give no trouble if care is taken
to keep them clean.</p>

assembled in front of mold ready to cast a slug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CAUSE_SQ">Causes of Squirts.</h2>


<p>Squirts will sometimes occur even if the pump-stop
attachment is supposed to entirely prevent
them. Two of the frequent causes of this trouble
are as follows:</p>

<p>First—When a line is given to the first elevator,
just as the machine is about completing its revolution
to deliver the previous line, and before the
elevator is fairly settled into place, the line may
become twisted, although not enough to prevent it
from going down into the casting pawls. The
mold cannot come forward far enough to close up
tightly on account of the twisted matrices, and the
result is a squirt, and the metal flies all over the
mold face and into the elevator jaw, soldering it
up and stopping the machine.</p>

<p>Second—If the part of the elevator jaw which
holds the upper ears becomes sprung, the matrices
will twist and you will get a squirt.</p>

<p>If vise automatic is not set properly, as described
under Fig. 15, a squirt is liable to occur.</p>

<p>When a squirt occurs from the first cause, many
operators open the vise and force down the jaw
until the line breaks away from the mold disk.
This will give rise to the second cause, by springing
the parts of the jaw referred to. This should
never be done, but this part of the jaw should be
loosened by taking out the three screws that hold
it in place and gently work the vise and line loose.
Clean the squirt and put piece back in place.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h2 id="DIRECTIONS">Directions for Facing Mouthpiece.</h2>


<p>In many instances a machine will squirt metal
back of the disk if the metal is very hot. As a
general thing, this is laid to the gas, but in nearly
every instance it will be found that it is caused by
the mouthpiece not being true with the back of the
mold.</p>

<p>In some cases it will be found that the mold is
warped slightly, but not often.</p>

<p>If the back knife does not trim the bottom of the
slug perfectly the metal will adhere to the back of
the mold, making high lines (<i>i. e.</i>, lines over .919,
as explained under Fig. 39), and also prevent good
contact between the mouthpiece and mold, which
would, of course, cause metal to squirt back of the
mold disk.</p>

<p>To prevent this, the mouthpiece should be faced
up true with back of mold, as follows: First send
a line through the machine, stopping at casting
point; then screw up the nut on end of pot lever
eyebolt until it touches the pot lever. This takes
up the pot pressure, so that when the vise is let
down the metal pot will retain the same position as
when casting a line. Then disconnect the vise-closing
jaw screw connecting rod by taking out the
wing pin on end of vise-closing jaw lever. This
will prevent the rod from being bent or broken
when vise is let way down.</p>

<p>Then let the machine finish the revolution. Now
throw off the driving belt and pull out pot pump
plunger pin and turn machine by hand to casting
point, disconnect mold disk slide and pull out disk
B (Fig. 34); thoroughly clean back of mold A
(Fig. 34) and cover with red lead mixed with oil,
or it will be found much better and easier to use
prussian blue oil paint, a tube of which will not
cost over 10 cents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px;">
<img src="images/page64.jpg" width="478" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="fs1 smcap">Fig. 34.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Rub the back of mold with this paint; push disk
B in until the back of mold A touches the mouthpiece
X (Fig. 34); then turn mold disk back and
forth, rubbing the back of mold over the mouthpiece.
The blue paint will thus be transferred to
the mouthpiece, and show the high points.</p>

<p>Should the paint show on one end only, throw
the metal pot around by means of set screws to be
found in foot of pot legs until it is about true:
then, with a small coarse file, file off the blue spots,
which are the high or uneven places. Then push
the mold in once more, and again rub mold on
mouthpiece and file off blue or high spots as before.
Continue this operation until the paint shows in
small spots all over the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>Before finishing this operation be sure to put in
the cross vents between the holes with a cold chisel,
making them a little deeper at the top, as shown
in Fig. 35. This will prevent porous or spongy
slugs.</p>

<p>After connecting the machine up again, put on
the driving belt and run through another line, stopping,
as at first, at casting point. Then let out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
nut on end of pot lever eyebolt until it is about
⅛-inch from back of pot lever.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 67px;">
<img src="images/page66.png" width="67" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="fs1 smcap">Fig. 35.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>If this is done as described there will be a perfect
lockup on the mold both back and front, the
only metal trimmed from back of mold being that
from the vents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>


<h2 id="CARE_MATRICES">Care of Matrices, Spacebands and Magazine.</h2>

<p>It is essential that these parts receive the most
careful attention. Matrices should be washed only
when absolutely necessary, which would be if oil
should collect on them. This will not happen if
machine is properly cleaned and oiled.</p>

<p>Matrices that have been used a long time will
sometimes show slight burrs, caused by walls of
matrices being crushed. If they are not washed
these small cavities will become filled up with dirt
and metal so that print will look clear. Washing
would, of course, take this dirt and metal away and
burrs would show worse than before.</p>

<p>Instead of washing matrices, rub the sides on a
piece of felt; then lock them up in a galley and
clean the face and front so the operator can read
the lines in the assembling elevator.</p>

<p>When a letter sticks in the magazine, take it out
and, after making sure that ears are not burred,
polish the ears with graphite and wipe them clean.</p>

<p>If a new set of matrices is treated in this way
before putting them into the machine there will be
little or no trouble with them sticking in the magazine.</p>

<p>Any burrs on the ears should be filed off, or they
also will cause the letters to stick.</p>

<p>In cleaning the magazine, do not use benzine unless
oil should have collected there by some means.</p>

<p>Be sure to lift up matrix guards at the lower end
of magazine 2-2-2-2 (Fig. 36) and clean the channels
on under side of these guards; also the channels
A (Fig. 36).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/page68.jpg" width="600" height="321" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="fs1 smcap">Fig. 36.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The spacebands should be carefully inspected
and metal should never be allowed to collect on the
slide. Metal on the spaceband slides will destroy
a set of matrices in a very few hours.</p>

<p>When cleaning spacebands, never use emery
cloth, as this polishes the slide and causes the
metal to adhere to it. The best way to clean spacebands
is to rub them in graphite on a board or
piece of felt nailed on a board.</p>


<h2 id="LAPPING">Lapping and Cleaning Molds.</h2>


<p>If a mold is warped (as referred to under directions
for facing mouthpiece), the only way to fix
it is to lap it down on a lapping block.</p>

<p>Figure 37 shows the lapping block B and mold
C that is to be lapped.</p>

<p>A lapping block is one of the most essential tools
to have in an office. If you do not have this block
procure it at once from the Linotype Company, or
one of the stock rooms. This block is of cast iron,
corrugated on one face.</p>

<p>To use it, sprinkle a small quantity of emery and
benzine on the corrugated face; then rub the mold
back and forth, as shown in Fig. 37, until you have
a perfect surface.</p>

<p>This block is also used to sharpen all the knives
on the machine the same way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>A mold should be taken apart and cleaned and
polished at frequent intervals, or the small grooves
which make the ribs on the slug will fill up with
dirt and cause the slugs to stick.</p>

<h2 id="ADJUST">Adjustable Molds and Liners.</h2>


<p>Figure 38 shows an adjustable mold and two
liners. These molds are made in three sizes for
each body, No. 14, No. 24 and No. 30, and cost
$30 each.</p>

<p>No. 14 will take liners to cast any length of line
from 14 ems down as short as may be desired.
No. 24 will take liners to cast any length from 24
ems to 7 ems, both inclusive. No. 30 will take
liners to cast any length of line from 30 ems to
13 ems, both inclusive.</p>

<p>These liners cost $1.50, and are interchangeable
for any size mold of the same body. For instance,
a No. 2 minion liner will give 12 ems in a No. 14
mold, 22 ems in a No. 24 mold, and 28 ems in a
No. 30 mold. This, of course, would apply to any
size liner.</p>

<h2 id="SPACE_BANDS">The Space Bands.</h2>


<p>Both sides of the spaceband slide 1 and 2 should
measure the same at top and bottom, but side 1
should never be thicker than side 2. On the other
hand, if side 2 be .001 thicker it will insure a better
lockup of the matrices.</p>

<p>Spacebands are made in two classes, thick and
thin. The thick bands present a minimum thickness
of about .0375 of an inch in the line, and
expand to .1, and are stronger and heavier than
the others.</p>

<p>The thin bands present a minimum thickness of
about .032 of an inch in the line, and expand to .095
of an inch, and are adapted for use where very thin
spacing is required; for example, in connection
with very small faces.</p>

<h2 id="POINT_SYSTEM">Point System of the Mergenthaler Linotype Co.</h2>


<p>This point system—adopted for convenience in
measuring—is nearly identical with that of Didot,
as adopted by the United States Typefounders’
Association. The size of a pica em, as understood
before the adoption of the point system, was one-sixth
of an inch, or .166⅔. The pica em adopted
by the United States Typefounders’ Association
measures .166, while the Linotype pica em measures
.168. The United States Typefounders’ Association’s
unit of measurement, or point, is .01383.
The Mergenthaler Linotype Company’s is .014.
Therefore 12 points × .014 = .168, or the Linotype
pica em.</p>

<p>All the Linotype matrix measurements are made
on the basis of .014 to a point, and .168 to an em
pica. The following table will furnish an illustration
of these dimensions:</p>

<p>To measure Linotype matter, take an em space
in the font to be measured, and ascertain how
many times it is contained in the matter to be
measured. The quotient will show the correct
number of ems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The length of molds is calculated on a basis of
166⅔ to an em pica, while the body or thickness
of slug is calculated according to the above table.</p>

<p>The slug should be the same thickness at points
1, 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 40). If the machine locks up
properly, and the back knife is set right, the slug
should measure 918 to 919 thousandths high from
bottom of slug to top of letter.</p>

<h2 id="MATRIX">Matrix Hair Spaces.</h2>


<p>These are furnished as sorts. They are similar
in shape to the em and en spaces, but are inserted
in the line by hand and automatically returned by
the machine to the quad box. They are of the following
thicknesses, respectively: .012, .013, .014,
.015, .016, .017, .018, .019 and .020 of an inch. Regular
thin spaces measure .028, .031, .035 and .0385.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="ADJUST_MOLD">Adjustment of Mold Slide and Disk.</h2>

<p>Adjustment of the mold slide is done by means
of two set screws, which adjusts the gib on which
it slides. This gib should be adjusted so that the
slide has .007 play. This will allow it to work
freely.</p>

<p>The mold disk is held in position for casting and
trimming the slug by means of pins attached to the
vise, called mold disk locking studs. The studs
are located in relation to the mold disk locking
bushings at the factory so as to give perfect alignment
of the matrices. They are dowelled in place
and should never be changed.</p>

<p>Should the bushings or studs become badly worn
at any time, renew them and thus keep the alignment
perfect.</p>

<p>The forward motion is imparted to the mold
slide by means of a roller which runs in a groove
in the mold cam and driving gear. This roller is
connected with the mold slide lever by means of
an eccentric pin that has a pin attached, which
serves as a handle with which to adjust it.</p>

<p>To adjust the slide, loosen the screw which holds
the eccentric pin with the T or a small monkey
wrench, and turn the handle so that the slide will
come forward until the face of the mold is within
.01 inch of the vise movable jaw at the time when
the line in first elevator is to be justified. If pin is
set so as to throw the disk too far forward it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
bind the spacebands and matrices and prevent the
justification levers from driving up the bands sufficient
to space the line, which would cause an
indention of the line. On the other hand, if the
mold disk does not come forward far enough, it
will not give a good lockup, owing to the metal
pot having to spring the disk too far in making the
final lockup.</p>

<h2 id="DIRECTIONS_NEW">Directions for Putting in a New Verge.</h2>

<p>To put in a new verge, first lock up the machine
and disconnect the rods; then take off the
magazine and place on a bench or other suitable
place, bottom up; then take off the verge partition
locking strip (which is held in place by some of
the partition’s ears being bent crosswise) up to the
verge that is to be removed. Withdraw the verge
rod until you have reached the verge to be renewed;
at the same time follow it up with another
rod, which will keep the other verges in place.
Then take out the verge.</p>

<p>In putting in the new one, be sure the hole is
large enough to allow the verge to work freely.
Then push the verge rod back into place. Put
back the locking strip and bend the partition’s ears
to hold it in place. The magazine is now ready
to be put back on the machine.</p>
